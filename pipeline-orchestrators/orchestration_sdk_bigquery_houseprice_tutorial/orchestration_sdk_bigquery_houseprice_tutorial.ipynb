    "## Wallaroo ML Workload Orchestration House Price Model Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a quick set of methods and examples regarding Wallaroo Connections and Wallaroo ML Workload Orchestration.  For full details, see the Wallaroo Documentation site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo provides Data Connections and ML Workload Orchestrations to provide organizations with a method of creating and managing automated tasks that can either be run on demand or a regular schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Orchestration**: A set of instructions written as a python script with a requirements library.  Orchestrations are uploaded to the Wallaroo instance as a .zip file.\n",
    "* **Task**: An implementation of an orchestration.  Tasks are run either once when requested, on a repeating schedule, or as a service.\n",
    "* **Connection**: Definitions set by MLOps engineers that are used by other Wallaroo users for connection information to a data source.  Usually paired with orchestrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on using Google BigQuery as the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will demonstrate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Wallaroo connection to retrieving information from a Google BigQuery source table.\n",
    "1. Create a Wallaroo connection to store inference results into a Google BigQuery destination table.\n",
    "1. Upload Wallaroo ML Workload Orchestration that supports BigQuery connections with the connection details.\n",
    "1. Run the orchestration once as a Run Once Task and verify that the inference request succeeded and the inference results were saved to the external data store.\n",
    "1. Schedule the orchestration as a Scheduled Task and verify that the inference request succeeded and the inference results were saved to the external data store."

If logging in externally, update the `wallarooPrefix` and `wallarooSuffix` variables with the proper DNS information.
