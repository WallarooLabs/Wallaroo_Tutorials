    "## Pipeline Orchestration Comprehensive Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a complete set of methods and examples regarding Wallaroo Connections and Wallaroo ML Workload Orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo provides data connections, orchestrations, and tasks to provide organizations with a method of creating and managing automated tasks that can either be run on demand, on a regular schedule, or as a service so they respond to requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Object | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Orchestration | A set of instructions written as a python script with a requirements library.  Orchestrations are uploaded to the Wallaroo instance |\n",
    "| Task | An implementation of an orchestration.  Tasks are run either once when requested, on a repeating schedule, or as a service. |\n",
    "| Connection | Definitions set by MLOps engineers that are used by other Wallaroo users for connection information to a data source.  Usually paired with orchestrations. |\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical flow in the orchestration, task and connection life cycle is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Optional) A connection is defined with information such as username, connection URL, tokens, etc.\n",
    "1. One or more connections are applied to a workspace for users to implement in their code or orchestrations.\n",
    "1. An orchestration is created to perform some set instructions.  For example:\n",
    "    1. Deploy a pipeline, request data from an external service, store the results in an external database, then undeploy the pipeline.\n",
    "    1. Download a ML Model then replace a current pipeline step with the new version.\n",
    "    1. Collect log files from a deployed pipeline once every hour and submit it to a Kafka or other service.\n",
    "1. A task is created that specifies the orchestration to perform and the schedule:\n",
    "    1. Run once.\n",
    "    1. Run on a schedule (based on `cron` like settings).\n",
    "    1. Run as a service to be run whenever requested.\n",
    "1. Once the use for a task is complete, it is killed and its schedule or service removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will demonstrate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a simple connection to retrieve an Apache Arrow table file from a GitHub registry.\n",
    "1. Create an orchestration that retrieves the Apache Arrow table file from the location defined by the connection, deploy a pipeline, perform an inference, then undeploys the pipeline.\n",
    "1. Implement the orchestration as a task that runs every minute.\n",
    "1. Display the logs from the pipeline after 5 minutes to verify the task is running."

    "\n",
    "* The version of Python used should match the same version as in the Wallaroo JupyterHub service.\n",
    "* The same version of the [Wallaroo SDK](https://pypi.org/project/wallaroo/) should match the server.  For a 2023.2 Wallaroo instance, use the Wallaroo SDK version 2023.2.\n",
    "* Specify the version of `pip` dependencies.\n",
    "* The `wallaroo.Client` constructor `auth_type` argument is ignored.  Using `wallaroo.Client()` is sufficient.\n",
    "* The following methods will assist with orchestrations:\n",
    "  * `wallaroo.in_task()` :  Returns `True` if the code is running within an Orchestrator task.\n",
    "  * `wallaroo.task_args()`:  Returns a `Dict` of invocation-specific arguments passed to the `run_` calls.\n",
    "* Use `print` commands so outputs are saved to the task's log files.\n",
