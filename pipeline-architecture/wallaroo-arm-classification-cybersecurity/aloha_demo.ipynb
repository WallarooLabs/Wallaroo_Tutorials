    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Wallaroo combined with ARM processors to perform inferences with pre-trained classification cybersecurity ML models.  This demonstration assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Wallaroo version 2023.3 or above instance is installed.\n",
    "* A nodepools with ARM architecture virtual machines are part of the Kubernetes cluster.  For example, Azure supports Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor included with the following virtual machines:\n",
    "  * [Dpsv5 and Dpdsv5-series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series)\n",
    "  * [Epsv5 and Epdsv5-series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will walk through a simple pipeline deployment to inference on a model. For this example we will be using an open source model that uses an [Aloha CNN LSTM model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348920204_Using_Auxiliary_Inputs_in_Deep_Learning_Models_for_Detecting_DGA-based_Domain_Names) for classifying Domain names as being either legitimate or being used for nefarious purposes such as malware distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, we will perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a workspace for our work.\n",
    "* Upload the Aloha model.\n",
    "* Create a pipeline using the default architecture that can ingest our submitted data, submit it to the model, and export the results while tracking how long the inference took.\n",
    "* Redeploy the same pipeline on the ARM architecture, then perform the same inference on the same data and model and track how long the inference took.\n",
    "* Compare the inference timing through the default architecture versus the ARM architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sample data and models are available through the [Wallaroo Quick Start Guide Samples repository](https://github.com/WallarooLabs/quickstartguide_samples)."

    "This is accomplished using the `wallaroo.Client()` command, which provides a URL to grant the SDK permission to your specific Wallaroo environment.  When displayed, enter the URL into a browser and confirm permissions.  Store the connection into a variable that can be referenced later.\n",

    "If logging into the Wallaroo instance through the internal JupyterHub service, use `wl = wallaroo.Client()`.  If logging in externally, update the `wallarooPrefix` and `wallarooSuffix` variables with the proper DNS information.  For more information on Wallaroo DNS settings, see the [Wallaroo DNS Integration Guide](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-operations-guide/wallaroo-configuration/wallaroo-dns-guide/)."
