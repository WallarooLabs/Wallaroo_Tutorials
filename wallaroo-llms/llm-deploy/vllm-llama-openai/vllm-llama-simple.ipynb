    "## Deploy Llama with OpenAI compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial demonstrates deploying a Llama LLM in Wallaroo with OpenAI API compatibility enabled.  This allows developers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take advantage of Wallaroo's inference optimization to increase inference response times with more efficient resource allocation.\n",
    "* Migrate existing OpenAI client code with a minimum of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo supports OpenAI compatibility for LLMs through the following Wallaroo frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `wallaroo.framework.Framework.VLLM`:  Native async vLLM implementations.\n",
    "* `wallaroo.framework.Framework.CUSTOM`:  Wallaroo Custom Models provide greater flexibility through a lightweight Python interface.  This is typically used in the same pipeline as a native vLLM implementation to provide additional features such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), monitoring, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical situation is to either deploy the native vLLM runtime as a single model in a Wallaroo pipeline, or both the Custom Model runtime and the native vLLM runtime together in the same pipeline to extend the LLMs capabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Upload a LLM with the Wallaroo native vLLM framework.\n",
    "* Configure the uploaded LLM to enable OpenAI API compatibility and set additional OpenAI parameters.\n",
    "* Set resource configurations and deploy the LLM in Wallaroo.\n",
    "* Submit inference request via:\n",
    "  * The Wallaroo SDK methods `completions` and `chat_completion` \n",
    "  * Wallaroo pipeline inference urls with OpenAI API endpoints extensions.\n",

    "* Wallaroo version 2025.1 and above.\n",
