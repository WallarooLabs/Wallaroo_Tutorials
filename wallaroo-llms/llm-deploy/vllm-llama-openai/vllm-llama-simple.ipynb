    "## Deploy Llama with OpenAI compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial demonstrates deploying a Llama LLM in Wallaroo with OpenAI API compatibility enabled.  This allows developers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take advantage of Wallaroo's inference optimization to increase inference response times with more efficient resource allocation.\n",
    "* Migrate existing OpenAI client code with a minimum of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo supports OpenAI compatibility for LLMs through the following Wallaroo frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `wallaroo.framework.Framework.VLLM`:  Native async vLLM implementations.\n",
    "* `wallaroo.framework.Framework.CUSTOM`:  Wallaroo Custom Models provide greater flexibility through a lightweight Python interface.  This is typically used in the same pipeline as a native vLLM implementation to provide additional features such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), monitoring, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical situation is to either deploy the native vLLM runtime as a single model in a Wallaroo pipeline, or both the Custom Model runtime and the native vLLM runtime together in the same pipeline to extend the LLMs capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses one LLM with OpenAI compatibility enabled.\n",

    "* Upload a LLM with the Wallaroo native vLLM framework.\n",
    "* Configure the uploaded LLM to enable OpenAI API compatibility and set additional OpenAI parameters.\n",
    "* Set resource configurations and deploy the LLM in Wallaroo.\n",
    "* Submit inference request via:\n",
    "  * The Wallaroo SDK methods `completions` and `chat_completion` \n",
    "  * Wallaroo pipeline inference urls with OpenAI API endpoints extensions.\n",

    "### Tutorial Requirements\n",

    "The following tutorial requires the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wallaroo version 2025.1 and above.\n",
    "* Tiny Llama model.  This is available from Wallaroo representatives upon request."
