    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates using LLM Validation Listener to evaluate LLM performance at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Validation Listener validates LLMs' inferences during the inference process.  These validations are implemented as an in-line step in the same Wallaroo pipeline with the LLM.  These validations are customized for whatever monitoring the user request, such as summary quality, translation quality score, and other use cases.\n",

These models monitor the outputs of the LLM and score them based on whatever criteria the data scientist developers.\n",
    "* These model steps evaluate inference data directly from the LLM, creating additional fields based on the LLM's inference output.\n",
    "  * For example, if the LLM outputs the field `text`, the validation model's outputs would be the fields `summary_quality`, `translation_quality_score`, etc.\n",
    "* These steps are monitored with [Wallaroo assays](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-model-operations/wallaroo-model-operations-observe/wallaroo-pipeline-assays/) to analyze the scores each validation step produces and publish assay analyses based on established criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upload a LLM Validation Listener developed to evaluate the output of a Llama v3 Llamacpp LLM previously uploaded to Wallaroo.\n",
    "* Add the LLM Validation Listener in the same pipeline as the Llama v3 Llamacpp LLM.\n",
    "* Perform sample inference and show the how the LLM Validation Listener scores the LLM outputs.\n",
