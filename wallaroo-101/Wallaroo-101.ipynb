    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Wallaroo, the fastest, easiest, and most efficient production ready machine learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is created to help you get started with Wallaroo right away.  We'll start with a brief explanation of how Wallaroo works, then provide the credit card fraud detection model so you can see it working.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes that you've installed Wallaroo in your cloud Kubernetes cluster.  This can be either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n",
    "* Microsoft Azure\n",
    "* Google Cloud Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "For instructions on setting up your cloud Kubernetes environment, check out the [Wallaroo Environment Setup Guides](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-operations-guide/wallaroo-setup-environment/) for your particular cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you run this notebook command at a time so you can see the results and make any changes you need based on your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an introductory guide to Wallaroo's user interface and SDK.  Most of the commands will be performed with the SDK, and the user interface version will be shown as a visual example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples will focus on the four pillars of Wallaroo:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy\n",
    "* Run\n",
    "* Observe\n",
    "* Optimize\n",

    "## Tutorial Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo lets you quickly get your models working with your data and getting results.  The typical flow follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connect**:  Connect to your Wallaroo Instance.\n",
    "* **Create or Connect to a Workspace**:  Create a new workspace that will contain your models and pipelines, or connect to an existing one.\n",
    "* **Upload or Use Existing Models**:  Upload your models to your workspace, or use ones that have already been uploaded.\n",
    "* **Create or Use Existing Pipelines**:  Create or use an existing pipeline.  This is where you'll set the **steps** that will ingest your data, submit it through each successive model, then return a result.\n",
    "* **Deploy Your Pipeline**:  Deploying a pipeline allocates resources from your Kubernetes environment for your models.\n",
    "* **Run an Inference**:  This is where it all comes together.  Submit data through your pipeline either as a file or to your pipeline's deployment url, and get results.\n",
    "* **Display Pipeline Logs**:  Observe the recent inference requests from a pipeline to track results and optimize based on an organization's needs.\n",
    "* **Undeploy Your Pipeline**:  This returns the Kubernetes resources your pipeline used back to the Kubernetes environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll use the Wallaroo SDK and the Wallaroo User Interface (UI) which is included by default in the Wallaroo JupyterHub service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed rundown of the Wallaroo SDK, see the [Wallaroo SDK Essentials Guide](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-sdk/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example and sample data comes from the Machine Learning Group's demonstration on [Credit Card Fraud detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)."

    "### Introduction to Workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A Wallaroo **Workspace** allows you to manage a set of models and pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working within the Wallaroo SDK, the first thing you'll do after connecting is either create a workspace or set an existing workspace your **current workspace**.  From that point on, all models uploaded and pipelines created or used will be in the context of the current workspace."

    "### Introduction to Models\n",

    "A Wallaroo **model** is a trained Machine Learning model that is uploaded to your current workspace.  These are the engines that take in data, run it through whatever process they have been trained for, and return a result.\n",

    "### Introduction to Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A Wallaroo **pipeline** is where the real work occurs.  A pipeline contains a series of **steps** - sequential sets of models which take in the data from the preceding step, process it through the model, then return a result.  Some models can be simple, such as the `cc_fraud` example listed below where the pipeline has only one step:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 0: Take in data\n",
    "* Step 1: Submit data to the model `ccfraudModel`.\n",
    "* Step Final:  Return a result\n",
    "\n",
    "Some models can be more complex with a whole series of models - and those results can be submitted to still other pipeline.  You can make pipelines as simple or complex as long as it meets your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a step is created you can add additional steps, remove a step, or swap one out until everything is running perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The Community Edition of Wallaroo limits users to two active pipelines, with a maximum of five steps per pipeline."
