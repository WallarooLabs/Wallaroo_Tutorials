    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Wallaroo, the fastest, easiest, and most efficient production ready machine learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is created to help you get started with Wallaroo right away.  We'll start with a brief explanation of how Wallaroo works, then provide the credit card fraud detection model so you can see it working.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes that you've installed Wallaroo in your cloud Kubernetes cluster.  This can be either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n",
    "* Microsoft Azure\n",
    "* Google Cloud Platform\n",
    "\n",

    "## SDK Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wallaroo SDK lets you quickly get your models working with your data and getting results.  The typical flow follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connect**:  Connect to your Wallaroo Instance.\n",
    "* **Create or Connect to a Workspace**:  Create a new workspace that will contain your models and pipelines, or connect to an existing one.\n",
    "* **Upload or Use Existing Models**:  Upload your models to your workspace, or use ones that have already been uploaded.\n",
    "* **Create or Use Existing Pipelines**:  Create or use an existing pipeline.  This is where you'll set the **steps** that will ingest your data, submit it through each successive model, then return a result.\n",
    "* **Deploy Your Pipeline**:  Deploying a pipeline allocates resources from your Kubernetes environment for your models.\n",
    "* **Run an Inference**:  This is where it all comes together.  Submit data through your pipeline either as a file or to your pipeline's deployment url, and get results.\n",
    "* **Undeploy Your Pipeline**:  This returns the Kubernetes resources your pipeline used back to the Kubernetes environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed rundown of the Wallaroo SDK, see the [Wallaroo SDK Essentials Guide](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-sdk/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/)."

    "\n",

    "### Introduction to Pipelines\n",

    "A Wallaroo **pipeline** is where the real work occurs.  A pipeline contains a series of **steps** - sequential sets of models which take in the data from the preceding step, process it through the model, then return a result.  Some models can be simple, such as the `cc_fraud` example listed below where the pipeline has only one step:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 0: Take in data\n",
    "* Step 1: Submit data to the model `ccfraudModel`.\n",
    "* Step Final:  Return a result\n",
    "\n",
    "Some models can be more complex with a whole series of models - and those results can be submitted to still other pipeline.  You can make pipelines as simple or complex as long as it meets your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a step is created you can add additional steps, remove a step, or swap one out until everything is running perfectly.\n",
