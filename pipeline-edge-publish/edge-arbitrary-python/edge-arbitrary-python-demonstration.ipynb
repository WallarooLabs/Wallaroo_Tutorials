    "## Arbitrary Python Tutorial Deploy Model in Wallaroo Upload and Deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use arbitrary python as a ML Model in Wallaroo and deploy the pipeline, then deploy that same pipeline to edge devices through an Open Container Initiative Registry, registered in the Wallaroo instance as the Edge Deployment Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arbitrary Python Tutorial Deploy Model in Wallaroo Upload and Deploy**: Deploys the `KMeans` model in an arbitrary Python package in Wallaroo, and perform sample inferences.  The file `models/model-auto-conversion-BYOP-vgg16-clustering.zip` is provided so users can go right to testing deployment.\n",
    "* **Publish pipeline to Open Container Initiative Registry, registered in the Wallaroo instance as the Edge Deployment Registry.**:  This will containerize the pipeline and copy the engine, python steps, model, and deployment configuration to the registry service.\n",
    "* **Deploy the Pipeline to an Edge Device**:  The pipeline will be deployed to an Edge device through Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arbitrary Python Script Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The entry point of the arbitrary python model is any python script that **must** include the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `class ImageClustering(Inference)`:  The default inference class.  This is used to perform the actual inferences.  Wallaroo uses the `_predict` method to receive the inference data and call the appropriate functions for the inference.\n",
    "  * `def __init__`:  Used to initialize this class and load in any other classes or other required settings.\n",
    "  * `def expected_model_types`: Used by Wallaroo to anticipate what model types are used by the script.\n",
    "  * `def model(self, model)`: Defines the model used for the inference.  Accepts the model instance used in the inference.\n",
    "    * `self._raise_error_if_model_is_wrong_type(model)`: Returns the error if the wrong model type is used.  This verifies that only the anticipated model type is used for the inference.\n",
    "    * `self._model = model`: Sets the submitted model as the model for this class, provided `_raise_error_if_model_is_wrong_type` is not raised.\n",
    "  * `def _predict(self, input_data: InferenceData)`:  This is the entry point for Wallaroo to perform the inference.  This will receive the inference data, then perform whatever steps and return a dictionary of numpy arrays.\n",
    "* `class ImageClusteringBuilder(InferenceBuilder)`: Loads the model and prepares it for inferencing.\n",
    "  * `def inference(self) -> ImageClustering`: Sets the inference class being used for the inferences.\n",
    "  * `def create(self, config: CustomInferenceConfig) -> ImageClustering`: Creates an inference subclass, assigning the model and any attributes required for it to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other methods used for the functioning of these classes are optional, as long as they meet the requirements listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Prerequisites\n",
