In order for the wallaroo tutorial notebooks to run properly, models must be downloaded to the models directory.  As they are too large for Git to contain without extra steps, this tutorial and all models are available as a separate download.  These are downloaded via the following procedure:

1. Go to https://github.com/WallarooLabs/Wallaroo_Tutorials/releases.
1. Select the most recent release.
1. Download the file `computer_vision.zip`.

This contains the entire tutorial, plus the model files.  The most current version of this link is there:
