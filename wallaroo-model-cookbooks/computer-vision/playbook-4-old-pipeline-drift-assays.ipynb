    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Insights feature lets you monitor how the environment that your model operates within changes in ways that affect the model's predictions.  This allows you to intervene (aka retrain a model) in an efficient and timely manner. Changes in the inputs, **data drift**, can occur due to errors in the data processing pipeline or due to changes in the environment such as user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation framework performs per inference range checks with count frequency based thresholds for alerts and is ideal for catching many errors in input and output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In complement to the validation framework, model insights examines the distribution of data within a specified window of time, and compares it to a baseline for a given pipeline. It can detect situations where values are still within the expected range, but the distribution has shifted. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a model that predicts housing prices you might expect the predictions to be between \\\\$200,000 and \\\\$1,000,000 with a distribution centered around \\\\$400,000. Then your model suddenly starts predicting prices centered around \\\\$250,000 or \\\\$750,000.  The predictions may still be within the expected range but the shift may signal something has changed that should be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we'd also monitor the _quality_ of the predictions, aka **concept drift**. However this can be difficult as true labels are often not available or are severely delayed in practice. That is there may be a significant lag between the time the prediction is made and the true (sale price) value is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, model insights uses data drift detection techniques on both inputs and outputs to detect changes in the distributions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many useful statistical tests for calculating the difference between distributions; however, they typically require assumptions about the underlying distributions or confusing and expensive calculations. We've implemented a data drift framework that is easy to understand, fast to compute, runs in an automated fashion and is extensible to many specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology currently revolves around calculating the specific percentile-based bins of the baseline distribution and measuring how future distributions fall into these bins. This approach is both visually intuitive and supports an easy to calculate difference score between distributions. Users can tune the scoring mechanism to emphasize different regions of the distribution: for example, you may only care if there is a change in the top 20th percentile of the distribution, compared to the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify the inputs or outputs that you want to monitor and the data to use for your baselines. You can also specify how often you want to monitor distributions and set parameters to define what constitutes a meaningful change in a distribution for your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've set up a monitoring task, called an assay, comparisons against your baseline are then run automatically on a scheduled basis. You can be notified if the system notices any abnormally different behavior. The framework also allows you to quickly investigate the cause of any unexpected drifts in your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this tutorial shows how to create assays to monitor your pipelines."

    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Insights has the capability to perform interactive assays so that you can explore the data from a pipeline and learn how the data is behaving. With this information and the knowledge of your particular business use case you can then choose appropriate thresholds for persistent automatic assays as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Model insights operates over time and is difficult to demo in a notebook without pre-canned data. **We assume you have an active pipeline that has been running and making predictions over time and show you the code you may use to analyze your pipeline.**"
