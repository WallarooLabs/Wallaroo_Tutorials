    "# Using Wallaroo to Discover Critical Computer Vision Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Wallaroo to detect objects in images through the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rnn mobilenet**: A single stage object detector that performs fast inferences.  Mobilenet is typically good at identifying objects at a distance.\n",
    "* **resnet50**:  A dual stage object detector with slower inferencing but but is able to detect objects that are closer to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial series will demonstrate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train a rnn mobilenet model and prepare it for use in Wallaroo.\n",
    "* Train a resnet50 model and prepare it for use in Wallaroo.\n",
    "* How to deploy a Wallaroo pipeline with trained rnn mobilenet model and perform sample inferences to detect objects in pictures, then display those objects.\n",
    "* How to deploy a Wallaroo pipeline with a trained resnet50 model and perform sample inferences to detect objects in pictures, then display those objects.\n",
    "* Use the Wallaroo feature shadow deploy to have both models perform inferences, then select the inference result with the higher confidence and show the objects detected."

    "\n",
    "1. Install Wallaroo and have an account available for use.\n",
    "1. This repository may use large file sizes for the models.  Verify that [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com) is installed."
