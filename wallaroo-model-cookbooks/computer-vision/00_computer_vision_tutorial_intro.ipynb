    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Wallaroo to detect objects in images through the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rnn mobilenet**: A single stage object detector that performs fast inferences.  Mobilenet is typically good at identifying objects at a distance.\n",
    "* **resnet50**:  A dual stage object detector with slower inferencing but but is able to detect objects that are closer to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial series will demonstrate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to deploy a Wallaroo pipeline with trained rnn mobilenet model and perform sample inferences to detect objects in pictures, then display those objects.\n",
    "* How to deploy a Wallaroo pipeline with a trained resnet50 model and perform sample inferences to detect objects in pictures, then display those objects.\n",
    "* Use the Wallaroo feature shadow deploy to have both models perform inferences, then select the inference result with the higher confidence and show the objects detected.\n",
