    "## Image Detection for Health Care Computer Vision Tutorial Part 00: Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial demonstrates how to use Wallaroo to detect mitochondria from high resolution images.  For this example we will be using a high resolution 1536x2048 image that is broken down into \"patches\" of 256x256 images that can be quickly analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitochondria are known as the \"powerhouse\" of the cell, and having a healthy amount of mitochondria indicates that a patient has enough energy to live a healthy life, or may have underlying issues that a doctor can check for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scanning high resolution images of patient cells can be used to count how many mitochondria a patient has, but the process is laborious.  The following ML Model is trained to examine an image of cells, then detect which structures are mitochondria.  This is used to speed up the process of testing patients and determining next steps."
