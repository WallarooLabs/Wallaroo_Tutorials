    "In machine learning, you use data and known answers to train a model to make predictions for new previously unseen data. You do this with the assumption that the future unseen data will be similar to the data used during training: the future will look somewhat like the past.\n",
    "But the conditions that existed when a model was created, trained and tested can change over time, due to various factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good model should be robust to some amount of change in the environment; however, if the environment changes too much, your models may no longer be making the correct decisions. This situation is known as concept drift; too much drift can obsolete your models, requiring periodic retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the example we've been working on: home sale price prediction. You may notice over time that there has been a change in the mix of properties in the listings portfolio: for example a dramatic increase or decrease in expensive properties (or more precisely, properties that the model thinks are expensive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a change could be due to many factors: a change in interest rates; the appearance or disappearance of major sources of employment; new housing developments opening up in the area. Whatever the cause, detecting such a change quickly is crucial, so that the business can react quickly in the appropriate manner, whether that means simply retraining the model on fresher data, or a pivot in business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Wallaroo you can monitor your housing model for signs of drift through the model monitoring and insight capability called Assays. Assays help you track changes in the environment that your model operates within, which can affect the model’s outcome. It does this by tracking the model’s predictions and/or the data coming into the model against an **established baseline**. If the distribution of monitored values in the current observation window differs too much from the baseline distribution, the assay will flag it. The figure below shows an example of a running scheduled assay.\n",

For example, we might collect the predictions of our model over the first few days after it's been deployed. For these exercises, we'll compress that to a few minutes.
