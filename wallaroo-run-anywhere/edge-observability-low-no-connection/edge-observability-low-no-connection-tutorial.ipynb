    "## Edge Observability with No/Low Connection Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo pipeline publishes are containerized versions of the pipeline, models and model steps, and the inference engine published to an Open Container Initiative (OCI) Registry.  Once published, they are used to deploy models to edge devices and used for inference requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge locations added to a pipeline published allow deployments on edge devices to connect with the Wallaroo Ops instance and transmit their inference results as part of the pipeline logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Location Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference request logs are stored locally in the edge device.  This storage space is configurarable during model deployment on the edge devices via the `LOCAL_INFERENCE_STORAGE` flag.  Inference logs are stored on the edge devices until the assigned storage capacity is reached.  At that point, logs are pruned on a \"FIFO\" - First In First Out method, where the first inference logs stored are the one pruned first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conditions where the edge device is unable to connect with the Wallaroo Ops instance for an extended period of time, logs are stored until connection is restored to the Wallaroo Ops instance.  When the connection is restored, logs are transmitted back to the Wallaroo Ops instance and added to the pipeline where the edge location is assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge inference logs have the inference DateTime is set to the DateTime the inference occured on the edge device, **not** when the logs are uploaded to the Wallaroo Ops.  Assays and other features that use inference logs are updated when they perform analyses with any new inference records uploaded by edge devices.  This insures that inference log information is synced across different edge devices without concern for when the data was uploaded, just when the inference occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload and deploy a sample real estate house price estimation to a Wallaroo Ops instance.\n",
    "1. Publish the pipeline and deploy to an edge device.\n",
    "1. Perform sample inferences on the edge devices.\n",
    "    1. Show inference logs from the local edge device.\n",
    "    1. Show inference logs submitted to the Wallaroo Ops instance from the edge device.\n",
    "1. Simulate a loss of communication on the Wallaroo Ops instance from the edge device. Perform additional sample inferences on the edge device.\n",
    "    1. Show new inference logs on the edge device.\n",
    "    1. Show new inference logs are not yet transmitted to the Wallaroo Ops instance.\n",
    "1. Simulate a restoration of communition on the Wallaroo Ops instance and show the inference logs from the edge device are restored to the Wallaroo Ops instance.\n",

    "  * `./data/normal-inputs.df.json`: A set of inference requests across a span of different house types and values.\n",
    "  * `./data/smallinputs.df.json`:  A set of inference requests that tend to generate house price predictions with low values.\n",
    "  * `./data/biginputs.df.json`: A set of inference requests that tend to generate house price predictions with high values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* A deployed Wallaroo instance with [Edge Registry Services](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-operations-guide/wallaroo-configuration/wallaroo-edge-deployment/#enable-wallaroo-edge-deployment-registry) and [Edge Observability enabled](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-operations-guide/wallaroo-configuration/wallaroo-edge-deployment/#set-edge-observability-service).\n",
    "* The following Python libraries installed:\n",
    "  * [`wallaroo`](https://pypi.org/project/wallaroo/): The Wallaroo SDK. Included with the Wallaroo JupyterHub service by default.\n",
    "  * [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/): Pandas, mainly used for Pandas DataFrame\n",
