    "## In-Line Model Updates at the Edge Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo pipeline publishes are containerized versions of the pipeline, models and model steps, and the inference engine published to an Open Container Initiative (OCI) Registry.  Once published, they are used to deploy models to edge devices and used for inference requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge locations added to a pipeline published allow deployments on edge devices to connect with the Wallaroo Ops instance and transmit their inference results as part of the pipeline logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline publishes can be replaced by new pipeline publishes from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new version of the same pipeline that creates a new pipeline publish.  In these instances, the edge locations associated with the pipeline publish are preserved with the original pipeline along with their pipeline inference logs.  Any input or output schema changes from the new models or models steps are reflected in the pipeline logs.\n",
    "* A separate pipeline with its own models and model steps.  In this scenario, the edge locations associated with the original pipeline publish are assigned to the new pipeline.  The inference logs are stored with the original pipeline, and new inference logs for the edge locations are stored as part of the new pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on pipeline inference logs, see [Inference Logs](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-model-operations/wallaroo-model-operations-serve/wallaroo-model-operations-service-pipeline-logs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IMPORTANT NOTE**:  Assays and other log data is based on the pipeline and model name.  If these values change, assays that are currently running will no longer generate analyses.  These should be paused, and new assays based on the current pipeline and model name should be created.  For more information, see [Model Drift Detection with Model Insights](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-model-operations/wallaroo-model-operations-observe/wallaroo-pipeline-assays/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package a model in Wallaroo and perform sample inferences.  Publish the pipeline and create an edge location, then deploy the model to an edge location.\n",
    "* Perform sample inferences on the edge location and verify the inference logs are added to the pipeline associated with the edge location.\n",
    "* Create a new pipeline version with a new model step and perform sample inferences.  Update the publish with the new pipeline version, and verify that the model is deployed to the edge location deployment.\n",
    "* Perform sample inferences on the edge location to verify the new model is being used, and verify the inference logs are added to the pipeline associated with the edge location.\n",
    "* Create a new pipeline with a different model and perform sample inferences.  Publish the pipeline, then replace the publish used for the edge location.  Verify that the edge location is transferred to the new pipeline.\n",
    "* Perform sample inferences on the edge location to verify model is updated from the new pipeline is being used, and verify the inference logs are added to the new pipeline associated with the edge location.\n",

    "  * `models/rf_model.onnx`: The champion model that predicts house prices.\n",

    "  * `models/gbr_model.onnx`: A new challenger model that takes the same inputs as `models/rf_model.onnx` and outputs house prices with a field of the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* A deployed Wallaroo instance with [Edge Registry Services](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-platform-operations/wallaroo-platform-operations-configure/wallaroo-edge-deployment/#enable-wallaroo-edge-deployment-registry) and [Edge Observability enabled](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-platform-operations/wallaroo-platform-operations-configure/wallaroo-edge-deployment/#set-edge-observability-service).\n",
    "* The following Python libraries installed:\n",
    "  * [`wallaroo`](https://pypi.org/project/wallaroo/): The Wallaroo SDK. Included with the Wallaroo JupyterHub service by default.\n",
    "  * [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/): Pandas, mainly used for Pandas DataFrame\n",
