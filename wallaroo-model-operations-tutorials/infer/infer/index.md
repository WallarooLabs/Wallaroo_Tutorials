Wallaroo inferences URLs are provided to allow users to submit inference requests through an HTTP API request.  Internal URls are enabled by default when a pipeline is deployed.  External URLs are enabled by Wallaroo admins through configuration changes through the Wallaroo Administrative Dashboard or other Kubernetes options.

Two tutorials are provided:

* Internal Pipeline Inference URL Tutorial: Shows how to use the Internal inference URL for a deployed pipeline.
* External Pipeline Inference URL Tutorial:  Demonstrates how to set the configuration options to enable the External Pipeline Inference URl, and how to perform sample API commands through the interface.
