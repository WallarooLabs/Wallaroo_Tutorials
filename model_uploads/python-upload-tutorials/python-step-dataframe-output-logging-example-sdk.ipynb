    "\n",
    "Python scripts can be deployed to Wallaroo as Python Models.  These are treated like other models, and are used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ML Models: Models written entirely in Python script.\n",
    "* Data Formatting:  Typically preprocess or post process modules that shape incoming data into what a ML model expects, or receives data output by a ML model and changes the data for other processes to accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are added to Wallaroo pipelines as pipeline steps, with the data from the previous step submitted to the next one.  Python steps require the entry method `wallaroo_json`.  These methods should be structured to receive and send pandas DataFrames as the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows inference requests to a Wallaroo pipeline to receive pandas DataFrames or Apache Arrow tables, and return the same for consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Wallaroo workspace and pipeline.\n",
    "* Upload the sample Python model and ONNX model.\n",
    "* Demonstrate the outputs of the ONNX model to an inference request.\n",
    "* Demonstrate the functionality of the Python model in reshaping data after an inference request.\n",
    "* Use both the ONNX model and the Python model together as pipeline steps to perform an inference request and export the data for use.\n",
