    "# Simulated Edge Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore \"Edge ML\", meaning deploying a model intended to be run on \"the edge\". What is \"the edge\"?  This is typically defined as a resource (CPU, memory, and/or bandwidth) constrained environment or where a combination of latency requirements and bandwidth available requires the models to run locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo provides two key capabilities when it comes to deploying models to edge devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since the same engine is used in both environments, the model behavior can often be simulated accurately using Wallaroo in a data center for testing prior to deployment.\n",
    "2. Wallaroo makes edge deployments \"observable\" so the same tools used to monitor model performance can be used in both kinds of deployments. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook closely parallels the [Aloha tutorial](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-tutorials/wallaroo-quick-start-aloha/).  The primary difference is instead of provide ample resources to a pipeline to allow high-throughput operation we will specify a resource budget matching what is expected in the final deployment. Then we can apply the expected load to the model and observe how it behaves given the available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the open source [Aloha CNN LSTM model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348920204_Using_Auxiliary_Inputs_in_Deep_Learning_Models_for_Detecting_DGA-based_Domain_Names) for classifying Domain names as being either legitimate or being used for nefarious purposes such as malware distribution. This could be deployed on a network router to detect suspicious domains in real-time. Of course, it is important to monitor the behavior of the model across all of the deployments so we can see if the detect rate starts to drift over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this example is not intended for production use and is meant of an example of running Wallaroo in a restrained environment.  The environment is based on the [Wallaroo AWS EC2 Setup guide](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-operations-guide/wallaroo-install-guides/YOUR SUFFIX-install-guides/wallaroo-setup-environment-community/wallaroo-aws-vm-community-setup/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Full details on how to configure a deployment through the SDK, see the [Wallaroo SDK guides](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, we will perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a workspace for our work.\n",
    "* Upload the Aloha model.\n",
    "* Define a resource budget for our inference pipeline.\n",
    "* Create a pipeline that can ingest our submitted data, submit it to the model, and export the results\n",
    "* Run a sample inference through our pipeline by loading a file\n",
    "* Run a batch inference through our pipeline's URL and store the results in a file and find that the original memory\n",
    "  allocation is too small.\n",
    "* Redeploy the pipeline with a larger memory budget and attempt sending the same batch of requests through again.\n",
    "\n",
