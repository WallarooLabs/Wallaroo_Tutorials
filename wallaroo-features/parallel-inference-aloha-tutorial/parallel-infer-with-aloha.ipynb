    "\n",
    "## Aloha Parallel Inference Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on the Pipeline method `parallel_infer`, which allows a List of data to be submitted to a Wallaroo instance for parallel inference requests.  This provides high speed increases in situations where data has to be broken up for size and memory needs, data is requested from multiple sources and submitted in a single request, or other use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will be using an open source model that uses an [Aloha CNN LSTM model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348920204_Using_Auxiliary_Inputs_in_Deep_Learning_Models_for_Detecting_DGA-based_Domain_Names) for classifying Domain names as being either legitimate or being used for nefarious purposes such as malware distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a workspace for our work.\n",
    "* Upload the Aloha TensorFlow model.\n",
    "* Create a pipeline that can ingest our submitted data, submit it to the model, and export the results.\n",
    "* Run a sample inference through our pipeline by loading a file.\n",
    "* Run a batch inference to show submitting a set of data to an inference request.\n",
    "* Split a DataFrame into a List of 1,000 separate DataFrames to simulate separate inference requests.\n",
    "* Submit the List of DataFrames sequentially and display how long this takes.\n",
    "* Submit the same List of DataFrames with `parallel_infer` and compare how long it takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Wallaroo version 2023.3.0 and above instance.\n",
