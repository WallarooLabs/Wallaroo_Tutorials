    "## Forecast and Parallel Infer with Statsmodel: Data Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial series demonstrates how to use Wallaroo to create a statsmodel forecasting model based on bike sales.  This tutorial series is broken down into the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create and Train the Model:  This first notebook shows how the model is trained from existing data.\n",
    "* Deploy and Sample Inference:  With the model developed, we will deploy it into Wallaroo and perform a sample inference.\n",
    "* Parallel Infer:  A sample of multiple weeks of data will be retrieved and submitted as an asynchronous parallel inference.  The results will be collected and uploaded to a sample database.\n",
    "* Data Connections and Orchestrations:  Now that the pattern has been set, we create an external data connection and a ML Workload Orchestration to automate the inference tasks on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, we will use a Google BigQuery dataset to retrieve the inference information, predict the next month of sales, then store those predictions into another table.  This will use the Wallaroo Connection feature to create a Connection, assign it to our workspace, then perform our inferences by using the Connection details to connect to the BigQuery dataset and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Wallaroo instance version 2023.2.1 or greater.\n",
    "* Install the libraries from `./resources/requirements.txt` that include the following:\n",
    "  * google-cloud-bigquery==3.10.0\n",
    "  * google-auth==2.17.3\n",
    "  * db-dtypes==1.1.1\n",
