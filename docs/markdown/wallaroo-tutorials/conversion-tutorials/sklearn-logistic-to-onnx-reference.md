## sk-learn Logistic Model to ONNX Outside Wallaroo

The following tutorial is a brief example of how to convert a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (aka sk-learn) **Classification ML model** to the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/ ) format for use with Wallaroo.

This tutorial assumes that you have a Wallaroo instance and are running this Notebook from the Wallaroo Jupyter Hub service.

This tutorial provides the following:

* `isolet_logistic_model_numclass.pickle`: a logistic trained sk-learn model.
    This model contains 617 columns.
* `isolet_test_data.tsv`:  A test file that can be used to verify the output of the converted logistic model.
* `test-converted-sklearn-logistics-to-onnx.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of the converted sk-learn logistic ML model in ONNX with Wallaroo.

## Conversion Process

### Libraries

The first step is to import our libraries we will be using.

```python
# Used to load the sk-learn model
import pickle

# Used for the conversion process
import onnx, skl2onnx, onnxmltools
from skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType
from skl2onnx.common.data_types import DoubleTensorType
from skl2onnx import convert_sklearn
```

Now we can determine the correct ONNX Target Opset for our libraries.

```python
# figure out the correct opset

from onnx.defs import onnx_opset_version
from onnxconverter_common.onnx_ex import DEFAULT_OPSET_NUMBER
TARGET_OPSET = min(DEFAULT_OPSET_NUMBER, onnx_opset_version())
TARGET_OPSET
```

    13

With the `TARGET_OPSET` determined, we can convert our sklearn logistic model to onnx.

* **IMPORTANT NOTE**:  Note that for the conversion process, `zipmap` is **disabled**.

Load the model that we will be converting:

```python
# convert model to ONNX

# load the model

with open("./isolet_logistic_model_numclass.pickle", "rb") as f:
    logistic_model = pickle.load(f)
```

    /opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:310: UserWarning: Trying to unpickle estimator LogisticRegression from version 0.24.2 when using version 0.24.1. This might lead to breaking code or invalid results. Use at your own risk.
      warnings.warn(

We already know the number of columns, so we'll set that variable in the next step.

```python
# Set the number of columns

ncols = 617
```

Next up is to set the options.  As a reminder **zipmap must be disabled**.

```python
## Set the options

initial_type = [('float_input', FloatTensorType([None, ncols]))]
options = {id(logistic_model): {'zipmap': False}} # here we turn off the zipmap
```

With everything ready, we can now convert the sk-learn Logistics model to ONNX, and store it in the variable `onnx_model_converted`.

```python
## Run the conversion

onnx_model_converted = convert_sklearn(logistic_model, initial_types=initial_type, options=options,
                       target_opset=TARGET_OPSET)
```

Now we can save our model to a `onnx` file.  Once complete, we can run it through the `Logistic Version of the Isolet Model Test in Wallaroo` available at the [Wallaroo Tutorials repository]https://github.com/WallarooLabs/Wallaroo_Tutorials/tree/main/model_conversion/sklearn-classification-to-onnx) to verify it.

```python
# Export the model to a file
onnx.save_model(onnx_model_converted, "isolet_logistic_model_numclass.onnx")
```
